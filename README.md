# TypeScript ATM using chalk and inquirer - Muhammad Shaheer Kamran

A cli ATM  designed witht the help of chalk and developed using TypeScript.
This somewhat complex TypeScript/Node.js project is
a console-based application. When the system starts the user
is prompted with a user id and user pin. After entering the details successfully,
the ATM functionalities are unlocked. All the user data is generated randomly
